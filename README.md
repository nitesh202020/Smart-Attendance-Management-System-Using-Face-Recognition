# Smart-Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition

To maintain the attendance record with day to day activities is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling
name of each student is time consuming and there is always a chance of proxy attendance. The following system is based
on face recognition to maintain the attendance record of students. We have used deep learning techniques to detect 
faces in images and deep learning method is used to compute and compare feature facial of students to recognize them. 
Our system is capable to identify multiple faces in real time.

The attendance is maintained in a excel sheet where the name and the entrance time of the student is recorded.
