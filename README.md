# Smart-Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition
<p>This project is capable of processing live video-stream of students entering their classroom and generate the list of students attending the class with exact time and date.</p>
  
<h3>Motivation Behind The Project</h3>
<p>As we all know online teaching is a great step in this covid era. We saves a lot of time by attending and deleivering lectures from home over the internet. But still, 
maintaining the attendance record is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling name of each student, time gap between muting and unmuting mike and marking attendance in register or updating in a excel sheet is time consuming and there is always a chance of proxy attendance. Thus to overcome this I designed this model.</p>

<h3>Other Useful Application</h3>
<p>Mobile Face Unlock System. </p>
<p>Finding missing person name from the face-list generated from roadside CCTVs.</p>
<p>Spotting VIPS during cricket matches.</p>
